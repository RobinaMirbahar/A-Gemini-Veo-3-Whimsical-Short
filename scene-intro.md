### 🌇 Warm Village Square
- Lighting: Golden hour, soft natural shadows (no harsh contrast or surreal light)
- Sky: Clear and soft
- Elements:
  - Colorful paper lanterns swaying above
  - Cobblestone paths glowing under the sunset
  - Ripe fruit stalls (peaches, grapes), leafy vines blowing gently

### 📸 Scene Description

The camera glides across a **sunlit village square**, brushing past:
- A rippling **fountain**
- Swaying **paper lanterns**
- A **fruit cart** brimming with peaches
- Children playing with a **wooden echo cone**

It gently follows a swirl of petals… to reveal:

#### 👧 Sofia
Peeking out from behind a tall bush.  
Her eyes are wide, posture tense, but upright. Her dress flutters gently, shimmering in the golden light. Her hands twitch slightly.

#### 🐿️ Squiggle
Crouched beside her, barely containing his excitement. Red scarf fluttering, tail flicking. He glances up at Sofia.

#### 🌸 Bloom
Hovering beside Sofia. Her petal dress floats gracefully. She glows faintly. She leans in with a gentle, warm voice:

> **Bloom (softly, warmly):**  
> “You’re ready. You know the words.”

Sofia turns, breath shallow, voice barely a whisper:

> **Sofia (timidly):**  
> “…But what if they laugh at me?”

🎥 **Camera pushes in.** The music box slows. The village hushes.  
Tiny glowing motes drift through the square. The moment holds.

Sofia doesn’t step forward yet…  
But maybe… almost.
