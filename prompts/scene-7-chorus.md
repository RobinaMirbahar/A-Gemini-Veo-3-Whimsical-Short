# 🎨 Scene 7: The Chorus — “Together Now”

🔗 **Style**: Whimsical Pixar-style 3D animation (Luca, Turning Red)
🎝️ **Tone**: Uplifting, celebratory, full of warmth
🕒 **Time**: Just after Sofia's second brave note in Scene 6

🎥 Opening shot — a slow swirl around the village square, now completely alive under the glowing lanterns. The light sparkles off cobblestones wet from a brief earlier sprinkle. The banana mic sits center-stage on a tiny woven rug. Petals float like confetti.

👧 Sofia, still in her flowing traditional pink Asian dress embroidered with golden threads, with her bright eyes and neatly tied black braid, now stands confidently in the center of the circle.
She holds the banana mic with both hands. She breathes.

🌸 Bloom hovers just above, her lavender petals gently pulsing like a heartbeat.
🐿️ Squiggle, wrapped in his red scarf and forest-green jumper, dances goofily nearby, miming a conductor with a twig baton.

🎶 Sofia begins to sing. Not loud. Not polished. But proud.
The children around her begin to echo — call and response.

🎵
Sofia: “Hi to you…”
Kids: “Hi to me!”
Sofia: “Hi to everything I see!”
Goat: Meeeh! *(on beat)*

🎥 Camera spins outward as the entire square joins in. A grandma hums with a tambourine. A sleepy cat paws at a xylophone. A kid flips on a tire swing to the rhythm.

💫 The petals lift higher, catching firefly light.
🌈 The camera pulls up into the night sky — showing the glowing village from above, now pulsing gently like a heart, alive with music and laughter.

👧 Final shot — a close-up of Sofia, her braid swaying, cheeks warm, eyes alight with something new.
Not just courage.
**Joy.**
