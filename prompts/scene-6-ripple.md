# 🎬 Scene 6: The Ripple — “She Sang.”

🕯️ **Style**: Whimsical Pixar-style 3D animation (inspired by *Luca*, *Turning Red*)
🎭 **Tone**: Heart-lifting, joyful connection
🌇 **Time**: Moments after Sofia’s smile and the gentle applause in Scene 5

🎥 **Wide shot** of the village square glowing in soft amber. The kids are now seated in a loose circle under fluttering lanterns. The banana mic rests in the center like a treasure. Flower petals drift gently, catching light like tiny stars.

👧 **Sofia** — still wearing her flowing traditional pink Asian dress embroidered with golden threads, her neatly tied black braid tucked over one shoulder — sits among them, legs tucked under, mic in her lap. Her bright eyes scan the group… and then something changes.

🎶 A soft hum escapes her lips.
It’s quiet — not perfect. But real.

🎥 **Camera pushes in slowly** as the sound spreads —
– A little girl with braids sways to the tune
– A boy taps a wooden spoon to the beat
– Even the trumpet goat bleats in harmony (somehow)

🌸 **Bloom** spins mid-air, scattering glowing petals like musical notes.

🐿️ **Squiggle** *(watching from atop the fountain, paws to his chest)*:
*(whispers dramatically)*
🎭 “She sang…”

🎉 The circle bursts into soft giggles and hand claps. A kid tosses her a garland of marigolds like it’s a music award.

👧 **Sofia** catches it mid-air — surprised, but smiling.
She looks up at Bloom. Then at Squiggle.
Then down at the banana mic in her hand.

**Sofia** *(quietly, to herself)*:
🎵 “I could do that again…”

🎥 **Camera pulls up slowly**, catching petals in the wind, paper lanterns glowing brighter, and the circle of children now gently bouncing together to a rhythm that Sofia started.

📚 *Lesson: Courage doesn’t end with one step — it grows with every voice that joins in.*
