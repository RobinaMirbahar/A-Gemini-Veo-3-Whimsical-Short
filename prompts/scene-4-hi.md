# 🎮 Scene 4: The Word — “Hi.”

🕯️ **Style**: Whimsical Pixar-style 3D animation (inspired by *Luca* and *Turning Red*)
🎭 **Tone**: Playful courage, softened fear

🌇 **Environment**: Golden hour glow spills across the cobblestone village square. Streamers flutter above. Flower petals float gently from unseen balconies. The banana mic glows slightly in Sofia’s hand.

🌸 **Sofia** — age 12, with bright eyes, a neatly tied black braid, and a flowing traditional pink Asian dress embroidered with golden threads — stands near the flower cart, heart pounding. She’s clutching the banana mic with both hands, her fingers trembling just a little.

🐿️ **Squiggle** stands dramatically beside her, still wearing the orange peel crown from earlier. His forest-green jumper is slightly crooked now, scarf flapping like a cape in the breeze.
He leans in with mock-seriousness, holding up an invisible scroll and squinting at Sofia with dramatic flair.

**Squiggle** *(booming)*:
📜 “In accordance with Article Four of the Banana Mic Rules… the stage shall now accept… ONE BRAVE WORD!”

🎵 The music hushes slightly.
**Bloom** hovers nearby, her lavender petals glowing in the warm light, offering quiet encouragement.

**Sofia** looks around again…
But this time —
*the village isn’t watching her.*
*It’s with her.*

– Kids bounce gently to the rhythm
– A small boy taps a beat on a tin bucket
– An old man at the fruit stand hums softly, nodding to her

A breeze catches the petals.
Sofia closes her eyes, then opens them again.
She takes a shaky breath…
And leans into the banana mic.

**Sofia** *(softly)*:
🎵 “Hi.”

⏳ A beat of silence.

Then—
💥 **Squiggle** lets go of the hanging banner line he was holding, spiraling through the air and landing in a cart full of beanbags.

**Squiggle** *(arms flailing)*:
🎉 “SHE SAID HI! MY HEART HAS EXPLODED!”

The square erupts in laughter — not at her, but *with* her.
One child echoes:

🎶 “Hi-hi-hi-hi!”
Another sings back:
🎶 “Hi to you and hi to me!”

Soon it’s a call-and-response rhythm.
Kids twirl.
Petals swirl.

🌟 **Sofia** blinks — then laughs. A real, unfiltered, joy-filled giggle.
She stands slowly. A little unsure, but steadier now.
Still gripping the mic.
Still wearing that same pink embroidered dress that flows gently in the breeze.

She lifts it again.

**Sofia** *(a little louder)*:
🎵 “Hiiiii!”

🐐 A goat harmonizes.
🐿️ **Squiggle** faints (again).
🙹 The cat skateboards by… and throws glitter.

🎥 **Camera swirls upward** — catching the golden sky, floating petals, circling kids, and **Sofia’s eyes lit with something new**: a spark of bravery.

**End of Scene 4.**
✨ *Lesson: Courage doesn’t start big — it starts with one small word.*
