# 🎬 Scene 3: The First Note — “Just One Word…”

🕯️ **Style**: Whimsical Pixar-style 3D animation
🎭 **Tone**: Playful courage, softened fear

🌆 **ENVIRONMENT**
The village square now bathes in golden hour light — warm rays spilling across cobblestone paths, dancing through hanging paper lanterns and brushing the edges of gently fluttering laundry lines above.
Oversized sunflowers lean out of painted clay pots.
A soft breeze sends pinwheels spinning and wind chimes tinkling from nearby balconies.
Even the air seems to sparkle — dotted with floating petals, soap bubbles, and the faint scent of sweet mangoes.
The music box melody continues — now gentler, like a lullaby with a heartbeat.

🎥 **CAMERA glides low**, drifting past:
– A sleepy goat wearing sunglasses made from orange rinds, humming along.
– A girl skipping rope to a tune about jellybeans.
– The cat in a top hat, now riding a turtle-shaped skateboard with remarkable poise.
Then, to the center of it all:
**Sofia.**

Still nestled in the soft pile of flower petals where she fell, her cheeks still a little pink.
Her bright eyes flick from face to face — not afraid, just unsure.
She’s in her flowing traditional pink Asian dress, golden thread catching the sun.
Her black braid curls delicately along her shoulder.

In her hands: 🍌 the banana mic.
🌸 **Bloom** floats beside her, petals gently pulsing with light.
She speaks with kindness wrapped in a whisper.

**Bloom** *(softly)*:
🌼 “You don’t have to sing it perfectly. Just sing it truthfully.”

🐿️ **Squiggle** suddenly drops in — upside down, dangling from a clothesline, scarf fluttering like a superhero cape.

**End of Scene 3.**
📚 *Lesson: Courage doesn’t mean being unafraid — it means showing up, even if your voice shakes.*
